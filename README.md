# Overview

This program written in Java, allows you to deal with bank accoucts and transactions. This robust system allows the user to engage in transactions. This system allows the user to do everything that a bank would do. The user can deposit money and withdraw from a particular account.

There should be a validation to make sure only a particular amount of cahs inflow at any time, as well as to make sure withdrawals if the balance is sufficient.

# Development Environment

Java is best suited for building and running mobile applications and this software can easily be used in an application for banking.
One of the libraries that helped me accomplish this program was a simple text scanner which can parse primitive types and string using regular expressions.
